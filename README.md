This repo contains my work learning C/Assembly, Reverse Engineering, and Binary Exploitation

- Up first is learning C.  For this, I am using the "How to Learn C" Roadmap from Roppers Academy.  This provides resources to help you get really good at C in a security context so that you can use it effectively for RE/Binex purposes.  The method I will be using is the K&R Book coupled with Dr. Charles Severance's course 'CC4E' (www.cc4e.com) and using the h0mbre assignmnet repo for projects/coding challenges.
